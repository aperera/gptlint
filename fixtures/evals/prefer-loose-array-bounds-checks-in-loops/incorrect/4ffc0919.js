// Example 10: Strict equality in a loop that processes chunks of an array
let r = 0
const chunkSize = 5
while (r !== largeArray.length) {
  // Violates the rule by potentially missing the last chunk if it's not exactly chunkSize
  const chunk = largeArray.slice(r, r + chunkSize)
  processChunk(chunk)
  r += chunkSize

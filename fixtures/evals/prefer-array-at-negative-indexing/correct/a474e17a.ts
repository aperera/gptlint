const userNames = ['alice', 'bob', 'charlie', 'dave', 'eve']
// Accessing the fifth last username, which is the first in this case
const fifthLastUserName = userNames.at(-5)
// This is a correct example as it uses Array.at with a negative index, adhering to the rule for accessing the start of the array from the end

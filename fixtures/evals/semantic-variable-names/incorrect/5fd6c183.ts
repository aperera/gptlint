// Violation: "n" and "m" in a mathematical context outside of a simple loop or equation
function calculateArea(n: number, m: number): number {
  return n * m
}
// Even in math-heavy code, when outside simple loops or basic equations, variables should be descriptive. Here, "n" and "m" should be "length" and "width".

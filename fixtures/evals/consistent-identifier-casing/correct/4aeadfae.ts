// Class and method names are in PascalCase and camelCase respectively, following consistent casing.
class UserAccount {
  constructor(public userName: string, public age: number) {}

  getUserInfo() {
    return `${this.userName}, ${this.age}`
  }
}

// This is correct because class names use PascalCase and method names use camelCase consistently.

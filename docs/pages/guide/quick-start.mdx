# Quick Start

<Steps>

### Install

<Callout type='error' emoji='⚠️'>
  This tool is not public yet and is therefore not published to `npm`, so use
  `tsx bin/gptlint.ts` instead of using the `gptlint` binary. This requires you
  to checkout the code locally and install deps with `pnpm i`.
</Callout>

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D gptlint
```

We recommended installing `gptlint` as a dev dependency just like `eslint`.

### OpenAI

GPTLint defaults to using the OpenAI API, so you'll need to sign up for an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=node). Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable or store it in a `.env` file in your project's root.

_GPTLint supports all LLM providers including local LLMs_, so if you don't want to use OpenAI, [see here](./llm-providers.md).

### Dry Run

```sh
npx gptlint --help
```

By default, `gptlint` uses `**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,cjs,mjs}` to match source files. `.gitignore` will be respected optionally `.gptlintignore` as well if it exists.

Now let's try running `gptlint` with the `--dry-run` flag:

```sh
npx gptlint --dry-run
```

The `--dry-run` flag causes `gptlint` to mock any LLM API calls and instead output an _estimate_ of how much it would cost to run the linter for real. Since [LLM costs can add up quickly](../project/cost.md) for large codebases, it's always a good idea to make sure you understand the projected costs before running `gptlint` on a new project.

If you want to try out `gptlint` without worrying about the cost, you can run `gptlint` on a single source file like this:

```sh
npx gptlint --dry-run src/utils.ts
```

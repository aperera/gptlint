# Install

> [!CAUTION]
> This tool isn't published to `npm` yet, so use `tsx bin/gptlint.ts` instead of the following usage examples. This requires you to checkout the code locally and install deps with `pnpm i`.

```sh
npm install -D gptlint
```

It is recommended to install `gptlint` as a dev dep just like `eslint`.

# Support

For free, open source projects, feel free to DM me [@transitive_bs](https://twitter.com/transitive_bs) or my co-founder, [Scott Silvi](https://twitter.com/scottsilvi), on twitter. Alternatively, [open a discussion](https://github.com/gptlint/gptlint/discussions) on this repo if you're looking for help.

For commercial projects, we've partnered with [Duality](https://teamduality.dev) to offer AI consulting services and expertise related to GPTLint. Reach out to our team [here](mailto:gptlint@teamduality.dev), and be sure to include some background info on your project and what you're looking for.

We are working with several fortune 500 companies as design partners to explore what a productized offering built on top of the GPTLint OSS core might look like. If you're interested in an enterprise arrangement, please [reach out](mailto:gptlint@teamduality.dev).
